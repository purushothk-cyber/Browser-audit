Objective:
To identify, review, and remove potentially malicious or unnecessary browser extensions, and to improve awareness about browser extension security.

Steps Performed:
1. Opened Firefox and navigated to the Add-ons Manager via `about:addons`.
2. Reviewed all installed extensions.
3. Focused on analyzing the extension "New Tab Suspender".
4. Examined its permissions and settings.
5. Verified its purpose and usage pattern to check for any suspicious activity.
6. No further suspicious activity found from other extensions.
7. Saved a screenshot showing the extension's settings page.

Extension Reviewed:
---------------------
| Extension Name     | Purpose                                 | Suspicious | Action Taken |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|
| New Tab Suspender  | Automatically suspends inactive tabs     | No         | Kept         |

Extension Analysis:
- The extension helps reduce memory usage by suspending unused tabs.
- It allows customization such as whitelisting and ignoring pinned or audible tabs.
- Permissions appear limited and acceptable for its functionality.
- No red flags found during review or online reputation check.

Screenshot Attached:
- `suspicious extension.png`: Shows the settings/options of the "New Tab Suspender" extension.

Key Learnings:
- Reviewing browser extensions manually helps detect potential risks early.
- Even extensions that seem useful must be checked for excessive permissions.
- Only keep extensions from trusted sources with clear purposes.
